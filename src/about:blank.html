<p>about:blank is an app that blocks websites in safari for <a href="">iOS</a> and <a href="">macOS</a>. I use it to break my bad browsing habits and to stay productive.</p>

<p>You specify the websites that you want to block on your iOS device, which are then synchronized across your other iOS and macOS devices over the iCloud.</p>

<p>The rules are based on regular expressions, which allows for fine control over a blocked URL. For example you can block the landing page of YouTube and still watch individual videos on YouTube.</p>

<p>To help you stick to your rules about:blank has an option that requires you to entering a random string to delete existing rules.</p>

<p>Furthermore you can block websites on the fly through an iOS safari action.</p>
