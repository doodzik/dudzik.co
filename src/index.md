Hello World,

My name is Frederik. I'm living and studying in Berlin.
I spend most of my time developing software. The vast majority of what I create is [Open Source](https://github.com/doodzik). 
I really like to [digress into development](/digress-into-development) and learn about new concepts and technologies.
Beside coding I'm on a quest to [simplify my life](/digress-into-minimalism), as in removing clutter and optimizing everything. 

I would be happy to [hear back from you](/contact).

Frederik Dudzik
