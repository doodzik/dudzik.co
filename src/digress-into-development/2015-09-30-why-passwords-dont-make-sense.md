Passwords infuriate me.<br>
They are the most frustrating ritual on the web.<br>
Each new internet activity forces me to come up with one more thing to keep track of.<br>
Every. Single. Time.<br>
And every single service keeps me logged in forever. So after they sign me out I have to reset my password anyway.<br>
And therein lies another problem. I can reset my password with my email account. If it is breached all my accounts are.<br>
The majority of websites could just use email only authentication. No password handling to implement and most importantly one less password to remember.<br>
