I've held an introductory talk on Category Theory today.
The slides have notes with additional information.
If you don't understand something feel free to contact me. 
I'm happy to help you and enhance the slides.

You can see the slides at [Category Theory: an Introduction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/190vmtEuM6yuc6sMZAzdt_M5d-LDcsd_ChiZBndLk-vM).
