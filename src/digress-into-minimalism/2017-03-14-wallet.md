I use my wallet almost everyday, so it is important that its handling is as effortless as possible.

I try to keep my wallet slim, which makes it look good in trousers, and easily removable from them.
To achieve that I use a [slim wallet](https://bellroy.com/products/note-sleeve-wallet/leather/java).
Furthermore I put my coins in my coin pocket. This also means that I don't have to take out my wallet for small purchases.
To make my wallet even slimmer I reduce the number of cards that I carry by [storing as many as possible on my phone](https://stocardapp.com) or in my small util-kit.

My wallet is separated into 4 compartments: For easily accessible cards, hidden cards, SIM cards^[The newer versions of the wallet that I use doesn't have this compartment anymore] and coins.
In the easy access compartment I have my ID, debit and credit card and my student card, which is also my ticket for public transportation.

The hidden compartment contains my driving license and my medical ID card. I use them rarely, but they are still important enough to carry around at all times. 
Additionally I found it to be useful to have a [SIM-Eject tool](http://web.archive.org/save/_embed/http://www.gsmsolutions.ie/shop/1368-thickbox_default/apple-iphone-ipad-sim-eject-tool-gold.jpg) stored in the SIM card compartment.
I store the access card to my workplace in the coin compartment, so I can open the door with my wallet.
Additionally I sometimes put single keys inside it.
