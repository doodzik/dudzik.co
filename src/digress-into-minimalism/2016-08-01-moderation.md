Acting moderately is a fundamental part of [minimalism](./minimalism).
It will help you reach balance and stability.
The following principles guide me:

- [Awareness of thoughts and actions](./mindfulness).
- Openness to change.
- Persistence.

Be moderate in reaching moderation. Don't deny yourself too much at first. Be prepared to start over. Don't let the notion of success and failure hold you back.
