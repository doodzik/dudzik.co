Behaving moderately will help you reach balance and stability in your live.
These guiding principles will help you in this endeavor:

You are aware of your thoughts and actions. 
Evaluate them.
Try asking yourself: Is this behavior appropriate?
If it isn't think about how you would like to behave instead. Find the smallest change you can make to move towards it. Don't deny yourself of too much at first. Be moderate and you won't relapse.
It is ok to fail. Analyze the reason, alter your approach, and start over again. Don't let the notion of success and failure hold you back.
