Operational goals are the tasks required to keep you as a person running. They are individual to each person and the following categorization is specific to me. It can and probably will look different for you. The important thing is to be aware of your needs and to satisfy them.

<br/>
 
## Health
If I'm not healthy, I won't be able to make money

### Physical Health
If I don't live a healthy life, my ability to focus on my work will suffer.

### Relationships
If I neglect my Relationships, my emotional health will suffer.

### Home
If I don't feel comfortable at home, I won't be able recover from work appropriately.

<br/>

## Money
If I don't have money, it will be hard to live a healthy life

### Uni
If I have a degree, it will be easier to prove my competence. 

### Learning
If I keep learning, I will have a competitive advantage.

### Investment
If I invest money, it will help me build financial stability.

### Work
If I don't work all the previous points can't be sustained.

You can use these categories to create goals or set allowances. The latter can be used to make you spend more time on other tasks. 

Don't neglect any of the categories completely though as they are intertwined.
