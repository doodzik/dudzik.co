We often forget how much we can achieve in one year and how little in one day. You can make sure each day counts by writing down a plan that you are going to [execute incrementally](/digress-into-minimalism/defeat-in-detail). Revisit your plan each year to make sure you are headed in the direction you want.

The plan should contain: 
1. ONE thing that you want to focus on that given year.
2. Your [operational goals](/digress-into-minimalism/operational-goals), which are the tasks required to keep you as a person running.

Include how to measure the success of your goals, the reasoning behind them and an outline of how you are going to achieve them.

Share the plan with people around you and get their feedback.

Reviewing the plan annually will help you focus on your personal growth. Quick periodic reviews can also help maintain the pace of your progress.

After all the planning, donâ€™t forget to execute!
