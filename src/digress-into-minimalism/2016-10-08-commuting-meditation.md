Practicing meditation can help you enter the state of [mindfulness](./mindfulness) more easily. So you should incorporate it into your daily routine as much as possible. One way is to take the practice of [walking meditation](http://www.wildmind.org/walking/overview) one step further and apply it to other forms of commuting.

While you are commuting focus on your surroundings. Specifically on the little details. Notice the tickling feeling you get on your sole while riding in the subway. The whistling of the wind while riding your bike. The rhythmic movement of a strangerâ€™s hand. If your mind starts to wander, focus on the next detail. Don't judge, think or react to your what you observe, as this can hinder your ability to be in the present. 

Obviously, do not meditate while driving.
