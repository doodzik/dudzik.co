I organize my belongings in kits, which are things that I can put things into.

They help me to categorize my belongings, which [enables me to argue](/digress-into-minimalism/mindfulness) about their place in my inventory.

I have three standard kit systems, which I can rearrange in a quick and easy manner.

A Big kit, which are see through boxes that have a lid.
A clear box removes the need for labels as you can see its content, makes it more resistant to water, and gives me flexibility in choosing its size. 

A Medium kit is a clear lunch boxes. It has a lid that is connected to the box and a clip to close it. This makes sure that it doesn't open while traveling.

A small kit is a soft glasses case with a snap lock.
It is convenient for travel as it is slim and small.

For some items it doesn't make sense to organize them in a standard kit. For those I use specialized kits like a [wallet](/digress-into-minimalism/wallet), or a wardrobe.
