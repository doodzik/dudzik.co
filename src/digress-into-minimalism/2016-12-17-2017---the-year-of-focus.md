In 2017 I will have to focus on my bachelor thesis until March. This leaves me with little time for my main and operational tasks. Focusing on the goals set in this year's [new year statement](/digress-into-minimalism/new-year-statement) should help me make 2017 worthwhile.

# Main Goal

> Creating reproducible processes to reduce the overhead of everyday tasks.

Writing articles for digress into minimalism forces me to verbalize my thoughts and makes them reproducible. 9 articles in 9 months is doable and it will allow me enough time for my other tasks.

The articles are important, but the site that they are hosted on should not be neglected. It is its backbone and deserves attention as well. Having [tasks to complete in 2017]() will ensure that the site won't stagnate.


Additionally I want to develop one minimal viable product (MVP), which should deal with my recurring tasks. I will use this opportunity to learn something new.


* write 9 Digress into Minimalism articles
* finish the "2017" project for dudzik.co
* create a MVP that helps me with my recurring tasks


## [Operational Goals](/digress-into-minimalism/operational-goals)


I'm overall happy with my operational performance, but there is still room for improvement. In order to be focused next year I will need to put some restrictions in place.


### Health
#### Physical Health


My focus this year will be my diet. I don’t like the feeling that I get after eating processed and fast food. I try to cut down my consumption by planning my meals and using fruits as substitutes for sweets. I will need some time to get the right processes into place. So I’m aiming for the beginning of the third quarter (Q3) to have it sorted out.
My stomach doesn't handle alcohol well. So I want to restirct my consumption of it entirely. 


* no processed food by the start of Q3
* don't drink any alcohol


#### Relationships


I'm happy with my relationships, but I have to set allowances and incorporate them into my overall strategy. Otherwise it will be hard to accomplish my goals. 


Niels is a school friend of mine and we have been skating together for more than 9 years. Unfortunately we don't live in the same city anymore. Going for 3-4 skate sessions and 2-4 skate videos seems ok.


Giving my parents 5-6 visits is a good way to keep them happy and me focused. This also ensures that we can spend a vacation together.


I would like to grow the relationship with my girlfriend. This means meeting her family in her home country and continuing learning her native tongue. As we live in different cities we should visit each other on a regular basis to keep the relationship healthy.


Staś and I meet in a polish summer camp in 2010. Now we are studying in the same field. I would like to spend time with him in person at least 2-3 times next year. Additionally I would like to write at least one paper with him.

Each visit is at least 48 hours and atop 5 days long

Niels: 

* 3-4 visits for skating 
* 2-4 videos

Parents: 
* 5-6 visits

Girlfriend:

* 500 new Chinese words
* 1 trip to her family
* visiting each other at least once a month.

Staś: 
* 2-3 visits
* write 1 paper


#### Home


Developing the MVP should cover this part. Other than that I don't see a way of improvement in my current situation.


### Money
#### Uni


Overall I'm happy with my progress at Uni. My thesis is the most important thing at the moment and my ability to focus determines how well it goes. I would like to study less during the next finals though. I should be able to achieve this by revisiting my lectures and adding them into spaced repetition program.


* finish my bachelor thesis
* revisit my future lectures


#### Learn


Learning new things is important. This year I would like to focus on the development of a stateless UI and making my code more predictable. This will happen in the context of the MVP development. To verbalize what I learned I will write 2 articles about it.


* 2 digress into development articles


#### Investment


I spend fairly little. So keeping my money in the bank makes me lose my purchasing power. I will try to maintain it. 


* don’t lose purchasing power


#### Work


I'm happy with my performance at my workplace. At the moment it is tied to my thesis as I'm writing it there. Until my studies have ended there isn't a way for me to advance. So until then I don’t have to focus on this too much.
