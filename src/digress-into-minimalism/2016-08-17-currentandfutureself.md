If you want to achieve a [goal](http://www.thebigbiggoalsclub.com/articles/_goaltypes.html) you need to be aware of the conflict between your current and future self.

Your current self is shortsighted and seeks [immediate gratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure_principle_(psychology)). On the other hand your future self is interested in your long term goals. Unfortunately your current self is in control. The easiest way to deal with it is to use its weakness against it. Having a well specified and simple task helps you use your current self's weakness against it.
