Accomplishing a [goal](http://www.thebigbiggoalsclub.com/articles/_goaltypes.html) can be a daunting task. Especially considering that your [current and future self](/digress-into-minimalism/current-and-future-self) are in conflict. Taking it step by step makes it easier to achieve. 

First split your goal into manageable tasks. Each task should be well specified and atomic. If you have a lot of tasks you can group them into milestones. Create  a checklist and set yourself a deadline for completing it. This makes your current self accountable. Complete [a few tasks a day](/digress-into-minimalism/moderation). Be consistent and you will reach your goal. After  your deadline passed analyze your process and move on.
