> A better life by constraining  yourself

### Conscious

Aware of yourself and your surroundings. Constantly calling your thoughts and behavior into question.

### Purpose

Freeing yourself from all noise. Only focusing on what you deem a priority and stripping away all the rest.

### Value

You assign value through functionality. Keeping only the essentials and enhancing them as necessary.

### Personal

No two people are alike. You have a different approach than me. This is alright.
All roads lead to Rome.

This blog documents mine.
